# House-Price-Prediction-Analysis
The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables affect the house price.

## Abstract

People looking for a new house tend to be more conservative towards the budget and market strategies. They always try to optimize the budget which matches their requirements and needs. Ideal home is something which fulfills and matches the customer requirement with an appropriate budget. So, price prediction is a very important thing when it comes to planning a budget. Mostly people approach a real estate manager or an agent who predicts price. This is helpful but it also increases your expense because you need to provide commission to the manager. Instead, when we have a website which predicts price for us, the time is saved and money too. It becomes easy for the customer to access it.

## Description of Datasets

Predictors - 'Transaction date', 'House age', 'Distance to the nearest MRT station', 'Number of convenience stores', 'Latitude', 'Longitude'  
Response - 'House price of unit area'  
Data Shape (414,9)

## Data preprocessing

The given data can be converted into more relevant form for our analysis by pre-processing it. For example, we will rename the columns to our convenience. We will also create bins for house age. This will help us visualize the data easily.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

An approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their characteristics, often with visual methods. 'House price of unit area' is the output or dependent variable. We have to find the value of output to predict a model that best fits the relationship between dependent and independent variables

## Model Building

The model building process involves setting up ways of collecting data, understanding and paying attention to what is important in the data to answer the questions you are asking, finding a statistical, mathematical or a simulation model to gain understanding and make predictions.  
Hear we have apply various model to get good accuracy such as LinearRegression,RandomForestRegressor,DecisionTreeRegressor,KNeighborsRegressor

## Model comparison and Conclusion

Model comparison approach to statistical testing is that it conceives of statistical tests of experimental effects as a comparison between two alternative models of the data that differ in the assumptions that they make.
